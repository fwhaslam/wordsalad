## General Concepts and Concerns

Concept is an abstract marker representing some untethered idea.   It is identified with associated labels ( words )
or phrases.  When concepts are combined, they become a 'meme' ?

Concern is a brand of concept that our project cares about.  For the monster hunters game, this will start with
Agents, Monsters, Traits, Surnames, Forenames, and Genders.

Dictionary is a general term for collections of linked concepts.  We will be working with many types of dictionaries.
In general, they will each have associated code to try to make them cross-comprehensible.

## Project Organization

ConceptFramework defines the tooling which allows dictionaries to comprehensibly combine answers.

WordService is the primary entry point.  The assumption is that a client project will use our service
to produce story-like content.
